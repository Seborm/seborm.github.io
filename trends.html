            <h3>What has been popular?</h3>
            <p>
                This fall 70's fashion is very popular! Many stores are featuring high waisted jeans, flared pants, and buttoned skirts! I personally really like this trend! Fashion is always changing, so it is exciting to see that todays trends are being inspired by the past!

            <img src="pics/brows.png" alt="eyebrow shapes">
            <h3>bold brows</h3>
            <p>
                There have been some crazy eyebrow trends recently. Some people have been going bold, braiding, or even shaving them off completely! What is your favorite trend? What is the craziest one you have seen so far? </p>

            <img src="pics/midi.png" alt="midi skirt">
            <h3>Are midis the new minis?</h3>
            <p>
                Many have been predicting the mini skirt is out and midi lengths are in! Being a short woman, I am not too sure if I am convinced. I do love a nice midi skirt, but come on minis are classics!
