    <h2>Makeup your mind already!</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <p> Makeup is always fun. You can create so many different looks! Here are some of my thoughts on the topic!
        </p>

            <img src="pics/glow.png" alt="highlighter">
            <h3>Getting the glow</h3>
            <p>
                I used to not really love makeup like I do now. This past year I have really started loving all things beauty. I was introduced to highlighter and everything changed. I love it. It makes you look glowy, without looking too shiny. I love Becca highlighters, but I recently fell in love with Rhiannaâ€™s new Fenty Beauty highlighting sticks. I 100% reccomend.

            <h3>How do people get eyeliner wings right?!</h3>
            <p>
                I am terrible at making my eyeliner look even. It pains me. I spend too much time trying to redo them to make the wings look even and I end up going wayyyy too far out. Some people say to use dental floss! they coat it in eyeliner and swipe up, creating an even line. Has anyone tried this? Does it really work? </p>

            <h3>Lipstick</h3>
            <p>
                I think that a bold lip color can totally spice up a look! Do not be afraid to try new colors out! Stores like Colourpop sell lipsticks as low as $5, so why not?!
